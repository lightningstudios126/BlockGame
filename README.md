Tetris but it's me programming it

Implementing full Guideline tetris in C# using Monogame/FNA and Nez.
Kind of experimental as this is mostly somewhere for me to mess around than an actual project.
Currently (hiatus), working on both implementing win/loss conditions and two player co-op mode.

Considering undoing the nullable reference types option because it makes interacting with FNA and Nez a big headache.
